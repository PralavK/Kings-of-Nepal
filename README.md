# Kings-of-Nepal

I have scraped Wikipedia for data pertaining to Kings of Nepal and the number of days they ruled.

I have added csv file (KingsOfNepal.csv) which I had scrapped from wiki. The data had to be furthur manipulted to get the number of days for 
each Kings.

The final data is stored as a csv (ShahKingsofNepal.csv) which was used for plotting.

I have used days instead of years for the plotting.
